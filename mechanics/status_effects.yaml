  Status effects are temporary conditions applied to characters that modify 
  their attributes, control capabilities, or deal damage over time. 
  Some are beneficial (buffs) while others are harmful (debuffs). 
  Elemental status effects may interact with one another and with environmental states.

# Elemental Interaction Overview
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
elemental_interactions_overview: >
  Darkhaven's elemental system is state-driven rather than purely damage-based.
  Certain status effects interact with each other and with environmental conditions.
  For example, fire-based effects can be extinguished by water-based states,
  and prolonged cold exposure can escalate from Chilled to Frozen.
  Environmental states such as Damp influence combat outcomes by modifying
  how elemental statuses behave.
